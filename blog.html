        <h1 id="day"> Day 1 -- starving</h1>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>3:00 p.m. ET</b> - we’ve just finished the drive up to Lake Superior. It’s a beautiful, cloudless day with blue skies. We’re on the lakefront highway, which divides the forest from the lake. There are a few fishing boats and some motorboats in the distance, but for the most part we’re completely isolated. Our phones actually don’t have service up here, so we’re using the compass app to navigate instead of Waze.
        </p>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>4:00 p.m. ET</b> - after a brief period where we realized we needed a permit to camp and considered just putting up a tent deep in the woods, we went to the Union River outpost in the Porcupine Mountains State Park. We parked our car next to the campsite and pulled all of our supplies out of the trunk. The tent was surprisingly easy to set up, because the ground was slightly damp and the stakes just went right in. After that, we set up our fire and ignited the mini-stove to cook some mac and cheese. While Ashwin boiled the water for the pasta, Ethan and Dheven put cans of Chef Boyardee ravioli by the fire and ate it out of the can lukewarm. We’ve decided to go hiking to collect better firewood after we eat our pasta, which is seasoned with salt and pepper that Ashwin brought from home. The trees are still brown, but the ground is covered with a carpet of bright green grass.
        </p>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>6:00 p.m. ET</b> - time for our hike. Dheven put flashlights and water in a backpack and distributed his knives amongst us. Ashwin took the Buckknife (the biggest one), Ethan took the Swiss Army Knife (the most versatile), and Dheven took the Gerber knife (small but surprisingly sharp). We headed south along the river into a marshy area with soft soil. We saw a beautiful waterfall. It wasn’t that big, but we could hear white water somewhere along the river. After moving further away from the river, we spotted an abandoned cabin with chopped firewood piled high outside. We put one piece in the backpack and Ashwin and Ethan both carried two. One hour later, we’ve returned to the campsite to drop off our stuff and get set up for the night. <br>
        </p>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>8:20 p.m. ET</b> - we’ve decided to make a run to the town of Ontonoggan, MI (population 202) so we can get some meat to cook tonight. We also brought our trash to dispose of there so that animals wouldn’t swarm our campground at night and possibly claw through our tent. It’s gotten cloudier and a lot colder, but we don’t think there will be any rain given the size of the rain clouds.
        </p>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>10:00 p.m. ET</b> - we’re freezing cold. We made another trip to the gas station to pick up charcoals and lighter fluid, because it seems to have rained before we got here and even the firewood we found outside of the cabin is too wet to ignite fully. The charcoal won’t create much light, but it’ll have a lot more heat, which should make cooking a less arduous process. It will also make it less cold, which is good because we all have our coats on and it’s still pretty chilly.
        </p>
        <p id="journal_content">
          <b>10:48 p.m. ET</b> - turning in for the night. The stars are out in full force tonight and so much more beautiful than they are in the city. The sky looks like a pitch-black piece of paper with pinholes of bright light shining through. Ethan heard an animal come sniff our heads through the tent while Dheven and Ashwin were sleeping.
        </p>
        <h1 id="day"> Day 2 -- freezing</h1>
          <p id="journal_content">

            <b>4:00 a.m. ET</b> - Ethan woke up. It’s bitterly cold. He waited 10 minutes for Ashwin to wake up and then ran to the car and turned the temperature up to above 80.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">
            <b>5:00 a.m. ET</b> - Dheven wakes up. He was a little worried when he woke up and no one else was in the tent, but knew once he felt how cold it was that they must have been in the car. 30 degrees in Chicago feels like it’s not that bad, but when you’re sleeping in those temperatures, you lose so much body heat. It was so cold we spent an hour in the car.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">

            <b>6:00 a.m. ET</b> - driving down to Lake Superior to watch the sunrise. We’ve now seen both sunset and sunrise here, and they’re both beautiful and slightly different. It was so cold no one wanted to get out of the car, but Dheven stepped out for a few seconds to take some pictures. Lake Superior is very different from Lake Michigan. It’s a lot bigger, but you can’t really see that. Mainly, it’s just way cleaner and clearer. It feels like part of a Pure Michigan advertisement.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">
            <b>6:45 a.m. ET</b> - drove back to the campsite for a light breakfast. It’s starting to warm up outside now that the sun is out, thankfully. It’s still too cold to take off our coats, but we had a banana and some protein bars. We want to go for a hike after breakfast.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">
            <b>7:15 a.m. ET</b> - stopped in a parking lot to hike up to Lake of the Clouds. It was a pretty short hike, and we got there by 7:45. It’s ridiculously beautiful out here, and we can see where it gets the name from. The lake is extremely reflective, and you feel like you’re just looking at an image of the sky when you watch it. We’re going to hike up on the Mirror Lake trail at 8. The map says it’s a 3.8 mile hike, so almost 8 miles both ways. We estimate it should take us somewhere around 3 hours.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">
            <b>1:00 p.m. ET</b> - well, we finished our hike. It took us 2 hours longer than we thought it would and it was significantly more difficult than we thought as well. It was 3.8 miles there distance-wise, but the trail was muddy and we had to take a circuitous route. There was also altitude, which we didn’t take into account. There were a ton of uphill and downhill sections. It seemed like we were crossing into several different biomes as we hiked. We started off in a typical forest environment and then began hiking along a river. Later on, we crossed lakes and had to jump and balance on logs to get over huge ponds in our way. We ended up getting pretty dirty and muddy as we tried to make overly long jumps and swing on unstable branches. Dheven did not bring a spare pair of shoes, and basically ruined his Vans. The worst part of the hike was definitely the heat. It started at 45 degrees and ended at near 80. We were all in layers and winter coats that we had to tie around our waists as it went from cold to chilly to warm to hot to sweltering. We also met a bunch of other hikers on our way, some local and some visiting like us. We have not seen a non-white person yet on our whole trip. It’s unclear if minorities exist here. We did see a lot of cool birds, though, and avoided some swarms of mosquitoes. After getting to Mirror Lake, we were sorely disappointed. There wasn’t a real viewing place, and it was difficult to even see the lake. I guess it’s about the journey, not the destination, but the destination was kind of terrible and the journey was also pretty hard. We were drenched in sweat when we finished, so we’re changing into fresh clothes and driving into Ontonoggan for food. We’re incredibly hungry, and cannot wait 3 more hours for our water to boil so we can eat. The burger and shake I had at this tiny diner was maybe the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my life. We also found a spot to buy dry firewood, so it’s looking like we’re going to have a real fire tonight finally.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">

            <b>4:00 p.m. ET</b> - Ashwin took a long nap, Dheven took a short nap, and Ethan just hung out by the fire, which is finally blazing like we wanted it to be. We’re starting to prepare our meals now, because our mini-stove seems to be broken and preparing food over a campfire is surprisingly hard. Ashwin brought pasta and marinara sauce for our main course tonight, but we’re eating canned mac and cheese and Chef Boyardee to tide us over until the water boils. We made a scaffold of sticks over the fire to hold the pot as we heat it. Unfortunately, the fire was so unsteady that it was hard to heat the water well. There was no even heat. Instead, we just threw as many dry leaves on to keep the fire as hot as possible, and put the pasta in before it was at a rolling boil. After 10 minutes of frantically trying to keep the fire as hot as possible, we opened the lid and stirred the pasta. It was al dente (read: undercooked) but it was definitely edible and tasted great after all the effort we had put in to make it. We’re still pretty hungry, so we’re going to eat some more Chef Boyardee out of the can.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">

            <b>7:00 p.m. ET</b> - the mini-stove keeps malfunctioning. We were able to heat up the red sauce for dinner, but it seems like that’s all we’re going to get out of it. We wrapped some potatoes in aluminum foil and put them into the fire to bake. This is when we saw Dheven’s true colors. This guy is a pyromaniac. He walked around holding the bottle of lighter fluid like a teddy bear. You could see the fire in his eyes as he kept spraying.
          </p>
          <p id="journal_content">

            <b>10:00 p.m. ET</b> - we’re going to sleep while it’s relatively warm tonight. We stargazed again, which was pretty cool. We wrapped ourselves in even more clothes and blankets in anticipation for how cold we’ll be in the morning. Dheven brought a Mylar space blanket that we didn’t use last night, s

        <h1 id="day"> Day 3 -- vomitting</h1>
          <p id="journal_content">
            <b>6:00 a.m. ET</b> - after Dheven poured the entire remainder of the lighter fluid on the leftover firewood and lit it up, we packed up early. We’re headed back to civilization now, and still have not yet seen a minority
